👨‍💻 This project was created as a solution to the assessment test for the Frontend Engineer position at Drift Consult. The assessment required creating a React application that displays a list of airlines from a JSON file, with the ability to open a modal that displays more information about the airline and a close button to return to the airline list. The project was built using React best practices and was made responsive to work well on a variety of screen sizes and devices. I hope you enjoy exploring [the site](https://elite-airlines.netlify.app) and learning more about different airlines! 😎✈️🌍
